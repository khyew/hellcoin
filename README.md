A hellish little crypto coin

# What is this?
This is a repository for collaborating on (entirely theoretical) devious smart contracts, intended to entrap the greedy with their own greed. [Inspired by this reddit post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/7sws4d/ladies_and_gentlemen_i_have_an_innovative_idea/)

Feel free to suggest ways of improving and elaborating on such schemes, for the glory of Evil. The code of contract implementations is in the repository; these may contain fun-killing bugs and could use review. 

# FAQ

## I have an amazing idea!!!
Great! Create a Github issue, or submit a pull request if it's a new contract variant and you can code it.

## What's the scam?
No scam. Only Evil for its own sake.

## How do I buy Hellcoins?
You don't. This isn't an ICO.

## Will this go to the moon?
Given that very few things of interest are currently on the moon and the costs of physical transport there are staggering, it seems unlikely this repository wlil meaningfully exist on the moon now or in the immediate future.

## How many 10xs will this do?!
Are you even listening?

## I heard the word "blockchain", and am seized with an irresistable desire to blindly throw money at something. Help?
No.


## Wait, are these contracts actually like... evil?
Think of them as teaching very expensive lessons in human nature.
That said, locking away Ethereum doesn't destroy any of society's actual wealth, so it's pretty harmless (unless you're the one losing it).
